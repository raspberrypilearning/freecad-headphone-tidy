## Sketch the cable cut-out

Now that you have the basic structure for the headphone tidy, you need to cut holes into the upper and lower sections. This is where the cable will be placed.

--- task ---
On either the upper or lower section of your model, select the large flat plane on the underside of the tidy.

Click on the **New sketch** icon to start sketching on this surface

Create a circle and a rectangle on the surface of the tidy with the **Create circle tool** and **Create rectangle tool**.

Now, affix the lower two points of the rectangle to the circumference of the circle. To do this, use the **Constrain point on object tool**.

Select the lower line of the rectangle, then press <kbd>Delete</kbd> (<kbd>Fn+Backspace</kbd> on macOS) to delete it.

Remove the arc between the lower two points of the rectangle with the **Trimming tool**.

Constrain the two uppermost points on the circle so that they are horizontal to each other.

Finally, use the radius constraint and the horizontal and vertical length constraints to fully constrain the sketch, as shown below.

Now that the sketch is fully constrained, close the sketch and return to your model.
